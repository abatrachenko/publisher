# Project Title: Auto-FAQ Blog Post Generator

This script generates a blog post based on a user-provided question. It uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate answers to the main question and related questions. It also utilizes the DALL-E API to generate an image for the blog post. The generated post is then published to a WordPress site.

## Features

- Generate detailed answers to user questions
- Find related questions
- Generate images using DALL-E API
- Create JSON-LD markup for SEO
- Publish the post to a WordPress site

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- WordPress site with XML-RPC enabled
- Python libraries: `requests`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git


2. Install the required libraries:

pip install requests


3. Set up the environment variables for OpenAI API key and WordPress credentials:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export WP_USERNAME="your_wordpress_username"
export WP_PASSWORD="your_wordpress_password"
export WP_URL="your_wordpress_site_url"


## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script:

python main.py

2. Enter the main question when prompted:

"Please enter your main question: "


3. The script will generate answers, related questions, and an image. It will then publish the post to the connected WordPress site.

4. Visit your WordPress site to view the generated post.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following parameters:

- Change the number of tokens in the answers generated by ChatGPT in `main.py`
- Modify the image generation process in `image_generation.py` to use different DALL-E API features
- Customize the HTML output in `main.py` to match your desired post format
- Update `wordpress_publisher.py` to include additional post metadata, if needed

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure you have the correct API keys and WordPress credentials set as environment variables.
2. Make sure your WordPress site has XML-RPC enabled.
3. Check the error messages and response status codes from API calls for additional guidance.
